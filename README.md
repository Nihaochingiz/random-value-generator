# RESTful API with Go

This is a simple example of a RESTful API written in Go that generates random values and allows users to retrieve them by ID. The API uses Gorilla Mux as the router and PostgreSQL as the database backend.

## Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL and Go on your machine.
2. Run the following SQL query to create the necessary table in your PostgreSQL database:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE generated_values (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       value VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. Update the database connection details in the Go code (`main.go`) within the `const` block based on your PostgreSQL setup.

4. Install the required Go packages using `go get`:

   ```bash
   go get github.com/gorilla/mux
   go get github.com/lib/pq
   ```

5. Run the Go application with the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## API Endpoints

- Generate a random value:
  - Path: `/generate`
  - Method: POST

- Retrieve a value by ID:
  - Path: `/retrieve/{id}`
  - Method: GET

## API Usage

Use the following curl commands to interact with the API:

1. To generate a random value:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate
   ```

2. To retrieve a value by ID:
   Replace `{id}` with the ID of the value you want to retrieve.
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/retrieve/{id}
   ```

Note: Make sure to replace `localhost` and the port numbers with the appropriate values if your server is running on a different host or port.
```
